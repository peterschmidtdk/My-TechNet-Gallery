This script copies the beautiful Windows 10 Spotlight pictures to another folder, so you can use them as background in Windows or on your phone.
As these images rotate from the original Spotlight locations maintained by Windows, so if you really want to backup all, please run this script every day.
  
During the backup process this script checks for if the picture is vertical or horizotal and moves to different folders.

The script can be schedule to run everyday.

Hope you like it. Remember to changes the target path in the script.
