updated May 16th 2013: version 1.6 - fixed download bug with ver. 1.5.

If you want to download the Lync Conference sessions for offline viewing.

I wanted to download the sessions as easy as possible and then the work on a PowerShell script started, which could automatically download the sessions for me. I have previously seen similar scripts for TechEd and MMS. So I adapted the script from TechEd and modified and optimized it for my use (Thanks to original credits below).

The script is made available, so everyone hopefully can benefit from it.

The script automatically downloads videos, PowerPoints or both, from the LyncConf.com site.

Be aware that it might take a long time to download, the full content is approx 26 GB.

Current version of the script: 1.4
