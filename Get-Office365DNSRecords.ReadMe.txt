- Version 1.1. - fixed typo when lyncdiscover record not found.

Get-Office365DNSRecords.ps1 is a small powershell utilities, to report the DNS records needed for all Office 365.

It creates two report, one listed in the PowerShell prompt and a more detailed report saved to results.txt.

Example of the prompted report for e.g. contoso.com:

No autodiscover record found for contoso.com
MX Records found for contoso.com
SIP TLS Records found for contoso.com
SIP Federation TLS Records found for contoso.com
No SIP record found for contoso.com
Lyncdiscover Record found for contoso.com
No MSOID record found for contoso.com

It is made to quickly validate DNS records for Office 365 setup.

---

This script scans a CSV file for a list of domains and then scans each domain for DNS records that may indicate which Office 365 services is setup in DNS.

All information is written as detailed output to a text file (results.txt).

Note: These are public DNS records, this is not getting anything not already published by the domain owner.

Use at your own risk, get the domain providers permission, look both ways before crossing the road.

Example use: Take a list the common domains your company emails and check if any of them may be used with Office 365.

It expects a CSV with a single column titled domains.
