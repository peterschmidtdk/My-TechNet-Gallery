Version 1.1 (Last updated: 2014-03-13).
Code mvoed from Tech Gallery to Github (2020.03).

Change-MailboxType.ps1 is a simple script for Exchange 2010 or newer, that makes it easier to change a regular Mailbox to either a Room, Equipment or Shared Mailbox vice versa. The script display a small menu with options. No need to remember PowerShell parameters.

Should also support Office 365, after a remote connection has been made to Office 365, see one of my blog post:

When the script starts, it displays a menu, from where you can choose among 7 options:

1) Show Recipient Type of a Mailbox
2) Change Mailbox Type to a Room
3) Change Mailbox Type to Equipment
4) Change Mailbox Type to a Regular Mailbox
5) Change Mailbox to a Shared Mailbox
6) Change Booking Window In Days for all Rooms (set number of days)
7) Change Booking Window In Days for all Equipment (set number of days)

The script Change-MailboxType.ps1 is made so it is easier and quicker to change Mailbox Type. The script is extended with a feature to extend the BookingWindowInDays for both Rooms and Equipment.

Will not work fully for Exchange 2007. Should work fine with Exchange 2013+ and for Office 365.
