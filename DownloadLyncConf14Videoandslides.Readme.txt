Microsoft has published all sessions from Microsoft Lync Conference 2014, which was held in February in Las Vegas. The sessions are available on Channel9.

This script will download all videos from Channel9 in mp4 high quality and slides (pptx) for all sessions, where available.

Inspired from the original script by Vlad Catrinescu (http://absolute-sharepoint.com) who made a script for the SharePoint Conf 2014. I have updated it to handle MEC 2014 and now LyncConf 2014.

All content are saved to C:\LyncConf2014.
